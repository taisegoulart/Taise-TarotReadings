                        <p>The tarot is a pack of playing cards, used from at least the mid-15th century in various
                            parts of Europe originally to play games such as Italian tarocchini, French tarot and
                            Austrian KÃ¶nigrufen, many of which are still played today.</p>
                        <p>In the late 18th century, some tarot decks began to be used for divination via Tarot card
                            reading and cartomancy leading to custom decks developed for such occult purposes.</p>
                        <p>In this app we are using just the 22 major arcana in the deck, but a full deck contais
                            another 56 cards, called the Minor Arcana. It is possible to do readings using only Major
                            Arcana, and also this practice it is recommended for someone who's beginning to study Tarot.
