                        <p>Here you will be able to do what we call "intuitive reading" using the using the 22 Major
                            Arcana of the Rider-White-Smith deck. In this spread, you draw as many cards as you want,
                            until you feel that your question was properly answered. </p>
                        <p>Please note that this spread can be a bit confusing for begginers, as you could be confused
                            if you get more cards than necessary to interpret the answer.</p>
                        <p>How you will know when to stop drawing cards? Just by practicing a lot. Usually 3-7 cards are
                            sufficient to give a proper direction. Be aware that here, the order of the cards which are
                            pulled are important and can change the meaning.</p>

                        (Remember this deck has 22 different cards, so after pulling all 22 you won't be able to draw
                        more cards. To continue reading cards, please reload to have a full deck again.)
